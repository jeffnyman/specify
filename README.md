Specify is a tool for leveraging RSpec to create an expressive DSL for test and data conditions. Specify will also provide test result reporting that recognizes the DSL.

Specify provides an internal DSL, similar to the [RSpec Story Runner](https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-stories). This was the predecessor of the [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) external DSL provided by [Gherkin](http://cukes.info/gherkin.html).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'specify'
```

To get the latest code:

```ruby
gem 'specify', git: 'https://github.com/jeffnyman/specify'
```

After doing one of the above, execute the following command:

```
$ bundle
```

You can also install Specify just as you would any other gem:

```
$ gem install specify
```

## Usage

To use Specify you simply have to require it within your `spec_helper.rb` file:

```ruby
require 'specify'
```

Because Specify uses a custom formatter, you should have an `.rspec` file with the following line in it:

```ruby
--format RSpec::Specify::Formatter
```

Then you simply run your `rspec` command as normal against your test suite.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake spec:all` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To experiment with the code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt. If you want to make changes and see how they work as a gem installed on your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

The default `rake` command will run all tests as well as a Rubocop analysis.

If you have rights to deploy a new version, make sure to update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`. This will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Credits

Specify has been inspired by the following projects. Each provided me with ideas for what to do and, in some cases, for what not to do. All were invaluable as I better considered how to leverage RSpec's functionality.
